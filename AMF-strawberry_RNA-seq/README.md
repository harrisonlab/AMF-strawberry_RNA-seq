# AMF-strawberry_RNA-seq

There's no transciptome for the octoploid - will need to build one.

Two transcriptomes will be built - de novo and genome guided de novo. 

Genome guided will have an extra step of aligning reads to the reference genome.

## Described here is the analysis using the <i>Diploid</i> genome
